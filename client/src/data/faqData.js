    question: "How the rating is decided?",
    answer: "Our rating system is based on multiple parameters including teaching quality, evaluation fairness, professor behavior, and internals management. We aggregate reviews from verified students who have taken courses with the professor, and calculate a weighted average to determine the final rating. All reviews are moderated to ensure authenticity."

    question: "Is the data 100% accurate?",
    answer: "While we strive for accuracy, professor ratings are inherently subjective and based on individual student experiences. We verify student accounts to prevent spam and fake reviews, but different students may have different experiences with the same professor. We recommend considering multiple reviews and parameters before making decisions."

    question: "What should be the priority parameters?",
    answer: "Priority parameters depend on your personal learning style and goals. If you value understanding concepts deeply, prioritize teaching quality. If you're concerned about grades, look at evaluation fairness. For project-based courses, check internals management. For overall experience, consider behavior ratings. We recommend balancing these factors based on your individual needs and learning preferences."
